# Study on the effect of urban density on nocturnal temperatures. 

This is a past project in February, 2017 for the Urban Meteorology class in the Department of Geography at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.
Night-time car traverse was done in Metro Vancouver area with mobile air sensor system. We investigate the intra-urban differences in air temperature by classifying selected marker
points of the traverse route into different Local Climate Zones (LCZs, discussed by Stewart and Oke, 2012) and compare the zonal differences in temperature statistics.
